// /*--------------------------------- Pseudo ---------------------------------*/

//create the board using html and CSS & JS.
//Come up with instructions for the game.
//create the inital position of Player 1 & Player 2's boards.
//Define the variables we want to use to track the state of the game. Including: left board, right board, hits (P1 & P2), misses (P1 & P2), turn, winner, ships sunk (P1 & P2).
//Define the variables to reference the cached elements of the DOM. Including: start button, player 1 button, player 2 button, reset button, board, messages.
//Create the ship objects for both players with properties - 2D array (horiz), 2D array (vert), hits, sunk, postiion.
//Create the two states being shown to the players. Player 1 state - the left hand grid is uncovered and the right covered. Player 2 state - the oppposite.
//Come up with a ship class that can be hidden so that the ships get hidden.
//When one of the sides is disabled the turn changes, this needs to disable being able to click on the squares on that side, and enable the squares being clicked on the other side.
//Come up with an initilized state and function.
//Come up with a render function - with updateboards and updatemessages functions.
//Come up with an event listener to respond to clicking of any of the squares.
//Come up with a handleclicked function which adds to hits or misses, which addes an 'X' to the space on the board, which changes the turn and the board, ships sunk.
//Come up with an If statement based on whether the square is a hit or a miss.
//Come up with an If statement to determine whether one of the ships has been sunk - this  will be difficult as there will be 5 different ships of different sizes.
//Come up with a winning function based on how many hits one of the players has (17 to win the game).
//Come up with an event listeners for the Player 1 turn and Player 2 turn buttons.
//Come up with event listeners for the start and reset buttons.

//REFACTORISATIONS
//Come up with a loop which positions ships randomly on the board. This will involve no overlap of ships including spaces around the ships. Also inlcude randomised orientation of the ships.
//

//Player vs computer pseudocode:
//.....

//QUESTIONS
//1. How would I create a ship covering 3 spaces with an image of a ship - but so that each section of the ship was a child of the space it occupied. Should I be treating the ships as whole ships or as spaces
//2. How can I build a randomized game board each time a new game is reset - surely this is as hard as playing against the computer.
//3. Should I be building the grids in html or should I create it in JS completely.
