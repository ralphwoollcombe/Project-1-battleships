GAME NAME: Battleships (Beetleships)
WHY: I chose this game because I wanted to challenge myself by choosing a game which requires lots of conditional loops. I also knew that there were lots of level options with this game. Battleships is a fun game, but where's the less macho, cute version, if I had this explorer version when I was younger I'd have played the game a lot more!

GETTING STARTED:
Play the game: [Game Link HERE]
Instructions: Click the “How to play” button on the site to view the rules.
Quick overview of gameplay:
    Each player has a 10x10 grid with hidden bugs.
    Players take turns guessing the location of the opponent’s insects.
    When a bug is discovered, it is revealed on the grid.
    The first player to find all five of the opponent’s bugs wins.
